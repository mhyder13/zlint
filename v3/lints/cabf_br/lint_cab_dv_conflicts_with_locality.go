--- Citation History of this Requirement ---
ยง9.3.1     v1.0   to v1.2.5
ยง7.1.6.1   v1.3.0 to v1.7.2
ยง7.1.6.4   v1.7.3 to v1.8.7
Superseded in v2.0.0 by a new general prohibition on extra name types not specifically allowed.

--- Version Notes ---
This practice is still prohibited, but the requirements moved from specifically prohibiting certain
name types to blocking everything but commonName and countryName in v2.0.0. (See e_cab_dv_subject_invalid_values)

This requirement was removed in v2.0.0 and is historical. The language below is from v1.8.7,
the last relevant version.

--- Requirements Language ---
BRs: 7.1.6.4
Certificate Policy Identifier: 2.23.140.1.2.1
If the Certificate complies with these requirements and lacks Subject identity information that
has been verified in accordance with Section 3.2.2.1 or Section 3.2.3.
Such Certificates MUST NOT include organizationName, givenName, surname,
streetAddress, localityName, stateOrProvinceName, or postalCode in the Subject field.
